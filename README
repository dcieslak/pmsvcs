PMS is a small tool aimed at maintaining local branches independent of
current VCS (Version Control System) used. Currently PMS supports the
follogin VCS-es:

 - Subversion
 - GIT
 - CVS
 - Bazaar (new!)

Usage: see attached documentation.

With no arguments pms shows help, list of local branches, current
local branch and state of files in working copy based on VCS used.

How does it work? PMS creates .pms subdirectory in current directory and holds
here pacthes (located by name) and current patch name (in .pms/.currect file).

Pretty simple!
